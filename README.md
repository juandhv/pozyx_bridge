# pozyx_bridge
This ROS package aims to provide a connection from the UWB Pozyx system to a ROS server. This package contains a node to connect via MQTT to the Pozyx gateway and then publish the transform of the tags' and their pose in a topic.

## Dependencies

````shell
sudo pip install paho.mqtt
````

## Quick Start

First you need to either modify the config file `pozyx_bridge_config.yaml` in the `config` folder or create a new file.

Then change the config file path in `pozyx_bridge_demo.launch`.

Finally run:

```` bash
roslaunch pozxy_bridge pozyx_bridge_demo.launch  
````

## Configuration Parameters

* `frame_id`: this is the parent frame used for the transform of all the defined tags.
* `frequency`: this is the frequency of publish of the transform and position of the tags. This frequency considers the rate of transferred data for each tag individually. It means that if a frequency of 100hz is defined with 4 tags, the rate of info for each tag is about 25hz.
* `tag_list`: list of tag names as strings.
* `id`: tag id configured previously, defined as a number.
